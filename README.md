# Welcome to My GitHub

## I’m Olivier Niyonshima  
Founder, AI Engineer, Full-Stack Developer, Digital Health Innovator

I’m a Computer Programming and Analysis student at Algonquin College and the Founder & CEO of ZeroX Intelligence and Medikal Africa. I build practical, scalable artificial intelligence systems for healthcare, agriculture, and education across Africa.

My work focuses on responsible AI, clinical intelligence, and real-world deployment — not just research prototypes. I am driven by a long-term mission: to position Africa as a global leader in innovation, resilience, and applied technology.

## What I’m Building and Why

I lead Medikal Africa, an AI-powered clinical intelligence platform addressing Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR) through clinical decision support, resistance surveillance, and multilingual deployment in low-resource settings.

My work is recognized by the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (Africa CDC), where I serve as a Youth Digital Health Champion under the Youth in Digital Health Network.

Through ZeroX Intelligence, I also lead infrastructure-focused innovation, including the deployment of autonomous UV-C disinfection robots to strengthen infection prevention in African healthcare facilities.
