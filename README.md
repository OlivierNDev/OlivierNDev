# 👋 Welcome to My GitHub

## I’m Olivier Niyonshima  
Founder · AI Engineer · Full-Stack Developer · Health Systems Builder

I’m a Computer Programming and Analysis student at Algonquin College and the founder of **ZeroX Intelligence** and **Medikal Africa**. I work on building practical, production-ready AI systems for healthcare and public systems, with a strong focus on real-world deployment across Africa.

I’m less interested in research demos and more interested in systems that actually run in hospitals, labs, and public health environments.

## What I’m Building

### Medikal Africa  
Medikal Africa is an AI-driven clinical intelligence platform designed to address **antimicrobial resistance (AMR)** as a systems problem.

The platform focuses on:
- AI-assisted clinical decision support  
- Resistance surveillance and early detection  
- Real-time hospital and public health analytics  
- Edge-first, low-bandwidth deployment for constrained settings  

Medikal was selected into the **NVIDIA Inception Program**, joining a global group of technically ambitious AI startups after product and technical review. Access to NVIDIA’s ecosystem supports how we train models, deploy low-latency inference at the point of care, and scale healthcare AI responsibly.

## Recognition & Leadership

My work has been recognized by the **Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (Africa CDC)**, where I serve as a **Youth Digital Health Champion** under the Youth in Digital Health Network.

Through **ZeroX Intelligence**, I also lead infrastructure-focused innovation projects, including applied AI systems and autonomous technologies for infection prevention, diagnostics, and public health visibility.
